## Lunar Plan Advisor

*Currently only for Lunar Denmark*

This is a simple web application that helps you to choose the best Lunar plan based on
your savings. It is built with [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) and basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## Rational

With Lunar paid plans, you receive positive interest on your accounts,regardless of the amount.

Lunar has an
[interest rate calculator](https://www.lunar.app/en/personal/positive-interest-rate-lunar)
to help you see what you can earn with different amounts and plans.
But it doesn't tell you which plan is most profitable based on *your* savings.

*Lunar Plan Advisor* helps you determine a plan based on the
*net profit* - interest income after plan fees.
It helps identify the point at which one plan becomes more profitable than another by
comparing the net profits of different plans.

## Privacy
It is a client-side application, which means that your data is not stored or sent to
anyone.
